# My Teamtreehouse techdegree project 2
This is my second project on the Treehouse Fullstack JavaScript techdegree.

Used technologies: HTML/CSS/JavaScript(ES6)

In this project the goal was to demonstrate our JavaScript DOM Manipulation knowledge, by creating a pagination to display max 10 students on the page and implement a worcking seach bar.

The HTML and CSS files are provided by Treehouse, but the JS file is self writen.
